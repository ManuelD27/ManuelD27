👋 Hi, I’m @ManuelD27

👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and software development.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced penetration testing techniques, secure coding practices in C, and automating tasks using Python.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools, C programming projects, and Python-based automation scripts.
